# Monastery Habit Tracking

Monastery Habit Tracking is an habit tracking mobile app, using X. Y, and Z technologies.

## Project Brief

- Users should be able to choose a habit they want to track (e.g water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep) and choose the frequency at which they want to track the habit
- Users should be able to track a habit and mark it as complete for the day
- Users should be able to see if they have completed a habit for the day and see their most recent completion streak

#### Project should meet the following technical requirements:
